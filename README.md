# Introduction
This is my own implementation of the classical Unix `wc` tool. For those who don't know about wc, it's a nifty tool that outputs words, characters, lines and bytes for any input file or standard input. From the official docs (just run `man wc` on any Linux/Unix-based terminal) -  "The wc utility displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output.".

## Project goals
This is my second coding challenge after building a spelling correction tool. Since the complexity of this project is low, I am aiming to try test-driven development here at the outset. I also want to learn the best practices for learning performance evaluation and benchmark this with the Unix `wc` tool on my machine.
